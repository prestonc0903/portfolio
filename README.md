# **Data Analyst | Data Scientist**<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Recent Data Science Master's graduate who is excited to transition into the data science and data analytics. Managing small-scale datasets and databases sparked my interest in programming and querying. My quantitative analytical experience in pharmaceutical research has strengthened my ability to collect, analyze, and present data effectively in high-demand environments. I am now proficient in the technical skills (Python, SQL, Tableau) required to excel in these data intensive roles.

## **Projects**
### [ClimbBot: The Discord Chatbot to Improve Your Climbing](https://github.com/prestonc0903/Discord_ClimbBot)
**Python** (Discord, Dotenv, BeautifulSoup, Pandas) | **SQL (Sqlite3)**| **Excel** 
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Rock climbing is different compared to other sports in because it's hard to know what you need to do in order to improve. While progressing to the next grade is the simplest way to determine if you're improving, getting to that next level is not as simple as adding more weight to a workout. ClimbBot aims to help users design workout routines based on their current level. The goal of the bot is develop a balanced boulder or top rope workout that can help climbers with their mobility, flexibility, strength, and most importantly confidence. Future versions will make the bot more user interactive and provide feedback based on how well the climber worked through the proposed workout.

### [Interactive Dashboard For Cathay Pacific Airline Reviews](https://github.com/prestonc0903/cathaypacific_tableau/tree/main)
**Python** (BeautifulSoup, Pandas) | **Tableau**
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Skytrak is a popular airline review website where individuals can rate and share their experience on certain airlines. The goal of the project was to extract the reviews, cleanup the data and create an user friendly visualization tool for individuals to see flyer's past experiences on Cathay Pacific.
